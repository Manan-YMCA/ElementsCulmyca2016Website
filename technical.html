                5.        It can be manual or autonomous as the user wants to have. <br>
                6.        The maximum length of the robotic arm is 40 cm. <br>
                7.        Time penalties will be given for every task that the bot cannot accomplish. <br>
                8.        No damage should be made by a bot to the arena or to other team’s bots during the match in any manner.<br>
                9.        The arena shown is just for reference. <br>
                10.       The judges can ask for an explanation of any mechanism on the bot and there would be an immediate disqualification of defaulters of any kind. <br>
                11.        Robots should not be factory made or commercially available.<br>
                12.        The wire used to power/feed the bot should remain slack at all times.<br>
                13.        Each team has to bring its own power supply for its robots. The voltage difference between any two points on the bot must not exceed 24 volts.<br>
                14.        Teams are advised to use an on-board power supply. In case they are using external power supply they will be responsible for any problem created by entanglement of wires.<br><br>

                <strong>TRACK :</strong> <br>
                1.        The track has three major parts. <br>
                2.        First part will have 3 boxes of different colours and 3 cavities of same colors respectively. The user will pick up the boxes and place them in his respective cavity. The block provided will be of 7cm*7cm to 10cm*10cm. <br>
                3.        Second part will comprise of an uphill course where the top will have a platform where a block is placed.The bot is required to go up there and hold the block up in the air. And while holding the block it comes down the elevation.Then it places the block in the desired position.  The maximum angle of elevation can be of 45 degrees. And the track can be of any material that may include even a slippery one. <br>
                4.        Third part and the most interesting one. In this stage the robot has to climb the hill again and then pass through a bridge made up of two parallel beams. On one-third distance of the bridge, there will be a block present in the middle of the beams. The robot has to pick that block, complete it’s journey on the bridge and then it has to place that block at the end point to mark the ending of the game.  <br>
                          If the robot falls from the bridge then the robot has to climb the hill again and has to cross the bridge again, no previous progress on the bridge will be considered. <br>
                5.        Black block and beam are on the same height. <br><br>

                <strong>JUDGING CRITERIA : </strong><br>
                1.        The bot which finishes the track in the minimum time including the time penalties will be declared as the winner. <br>
                2.        The dimensions and weight limit of the bot must be strictly followed. All the bots will be checked before the competition begins. The bots not made according to the rule will be disqualified. <br>
                3.        The decision of the co-ordinators will be considered as the final decision. <br>
                4.        In case of toppling, the co-ordinators will reposition the bot,  the participating members will not do this. <br><br>

                <strong>Points System :</strong> <br>
                Points will be calculated in the following manner : <br>
                100 points will be awarded for placing the green block on it’s desired place. <br>
                100 points will be awarded for placing the red block on it’s desired place. <br>
                100 points will be awarded for placing the orange block on it’s desired place. <br>
                200 points will be awarded for placing the blue block on it’s desired place. <br>
                100 points will be awarded for placing the black block on it’s desired place. <br>
                100 points will be awarded as a bonus if all the blocks are placed at their desired places. <br>
                (3*t) will be subtracted from the final score , where t is time in seconds. <br>
