A Treasure Hunt is always amongst the most celebrated events of a fest owing to its high ranking in the fun department. Keeping up with last year's tradition, we once again invite students to tap into their spirit of adventure as they team up, hunt for clues on their cycles and crack puzzles designed by some of the best minds of IISc. The event is entirely non-technical and the only prerequisite for participation is perhaps is the ability to ride a cycle! <br>
Pravega 2015 proudly hands students an opportunity to play the explorer with their friends and set off on an exciting little journey that promises to challenge their mental as well as physical abilities.
