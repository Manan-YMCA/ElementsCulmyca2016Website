For people to whom physics happens over a steaming cup of tea, a comfortable armchair and a 

black board, Armchair Physicist gives an opportunity to make good use of their mental acumen 

and solve challenging problems. In the second edition of the Armchair 

Physicist, we invite Physics lovers to take part in this event, which, through its two well-designed 

sections, will surely entertain them thoroughly. If Dexter's Laboratory is about bringing out the 

Sherlock Holmes in you, Armchair Physicist will surely tickle your little grey cells, much like his 

Belgian counterpart, Hercule Poirot!
