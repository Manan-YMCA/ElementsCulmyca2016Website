A Treasure Hunt is always amongst the most celebrated events of a fest owing to its high ranking in the fun department. Keeping up with last year's tradition, we once again invite students to tap into their spirit of adventure as they team up, hunt for clues on their cycles and crack puzzles designed by some of the best minds of IISc. The event is entirely non-technical and the only prerequisite for participation is perhaps is the ability to ride a cycle! <br>
Pravega 2015 proudly hands students an opportunity to play the explorer with their friends and set off on an exciting little journey that promises to challenge their mental as well as physical abilities.

What if you and I could also do what Jesus did: love humanity, alleviate their sufferings, andâ€¦ 

Walk on water!

While the first two can be a bit difficult with so many physics haters all around, we can definitely 

walk on fluids, dance and play football on it. But, for that, the fluid must be, well, non-

Newtonian! While the rest of the world plays football on Fifa to chill out, we invite science 

freaks to take part in this fun event and play football on fluids for fun!
